# Dublin Bikes Dashboard

## Overview

Welcome to our collaborative project, where we aim to enhance urban mobility and promote environmentally friendly transportation. Our web application serves as a dual-purpose platform that allows users to:

- **Locate Bike Stations**: Users can find nearby bike stations, view the number of available bikes, and navigate the city more sustainably.
- **Check Weather Conditions**: In addition to bike availability, users can check real-time weather conditions to plan their trips more effectively.

This tool is built for city dwellers, tourists, and anyone interested in using bicycles as a mode of transportation, while considering the weather conditions that might affect their journey.
